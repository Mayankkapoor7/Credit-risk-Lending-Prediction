Credit Risk Lending Prediction:
Built a multi-class classification model to predict credit risk levels by classifying loan applicants into four priority categories (P1â€“P4), aiding in informed lending decisions.

Performed extensive EDA and applied Chi-square and ANOVA tests to identify statistically significant categorical and numerical features impacting approval status.

Addressed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and handled class imbalance via SMOTE to ensure robust model training.

Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier, achieving ~77% accuracy and high F1-scores, with precision-recall breakdowns across all classes for detailed performance insights.
